# English files for H2M

This README provides instructions on how to switch your H2M game language to English. Please follow the steps carefully to ensure a smooth transition.

## Important: Backup Your Game

Before proceeding, **make a copy of your entire game directory**. This will allow you to restore the original files if something goes wrong or if you wish to revert to your previous language.

## Steps to Install English Language Files:

1. **Download the English Language Files:**
   - Use the torrent provided to download the English language files. Make sure the download completes successfully before proceeding.

2. **Locate Your Game Directory:**
   - Navigate to the root directory of your **H2M** game installation. This is where your game files are stored (often named `mwr` or similar).

3. **Add the English Language Files:**
   - Extract the downloaded files. You will find:
     - A folder named `english` filled with several files named `eng_xxxxxx.ff`.
     - A single file named `eng_xxxxxxxx.ff` (outside the `english` folder).
   - Move the entire `english` folder into the root of your game directory.
   - Place the `eng_xxxxxxxx.ff` file directly in the root of your game directory (alongside your other main game files).

4. **Remove Your Current Language Folder:**
   - Inside your game directory, locate the folder corresponding to your current language (e.g., `french`, `german`, etc.). Delete this folder to remove the existing language files.

5. **Set English as Your Language:**
   - With the `english` folder and the `eng_xxxxxxxx.ff` file now in place, the game will automatically use English as the language.

6. **Start the Game:**
   - Launch the game as usual. The language should now be set to English.

## Important Notes:

- **Backup:** Itâ€™s recommended to back up your original language files before proceeding, in case you want to revert to your original language.
- **Compatibility:** Make sure the downloaded files are compatible with your version of the game.
- **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter any issues, double-check the placement of the `english` folder and the `eng_xxxxxxxx.ff` file, and ensure the old language folder is fully deleted.

Enjoy your game in English!
